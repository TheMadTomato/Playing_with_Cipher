# Ceasar Cipher
## Introduction
The Ceasar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate with his generals, this method involves cyclical shifts. For instance, if the shift is 3, then the letter A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. When you reach the end of the alphabet, the next letter is the beginning of the alphabet.  
## Release
The exact release date of the Ceasar Cipher is not known, but it is believed to have been used since the time of Julius Caesar around 58 BC.  
## Type and Techniques
Ceasar Cipher falls under the category of Substitution Cipher, which is a part of Symmetric Key Cryptography. In this technique, the identity of the characters is changed while their positions remain the same. The technique used in Ceasar Cipher is a simple shift of characters.  
## Strengths
The strength of the Ceasar Cipher lies in its simplicity and ease of use. It is easy to understand and implement.
It provides a basic level of security for non-critical data and can be used as a stepping stone to understand more complex encryption techniques.
## Weaknesses
The main weakness of the Ceasar Cipher is its vulnerability to both brute force attacks and frequency analysis. Since there are only 25 possible keys, an attacker can easily try all of them and decipher the message.
It is also vulnerable to frequency analysis. Since it doesn't alter the frequency of characters in the plaintext, a cryptanalyst can use the frequency of certain characters to make educated guesses about the plaintext.
## Python Implementation
In the provided Python implementation, the Ceasar Cipher is implemented as two main functions: encrypt and decrypt. The encrypt function works by shifting each character in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The decrypt function works by shifting the characters in the opposite direction. The implementation also includes a brute_force_decrypt function that tries all possible keys to decrypt a given ciphertext.
